# BobMod
BobMod provides an Inventory GUI for in-game moderation with LiteBans. The in-game menus allow mods to view player ban, mute, and warning history, as well as ban, warn, or mute players.
All moderation actions through the GUI are done with pre-defined actions, reasons, and durations specified in the configuration file. I may change this later if anyone has any requests.
This plugin is currently in development, but seems to be stable and gets the job done.
If you do happen to use it and run across any bugs please let me know in the Github Issues.

This is basically just a plugin that DevCow helped me with about a year ago, and I've just fixed a few bugs recently and made sure it would work with 1.16.5.

# Commands
`/bob-mod <player>`: Pulls up the moderation GUI for the specified player.
